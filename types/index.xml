    <prop type="string|!Array<string>" name="directory" default="frontend">
      The directory or directories from which to serve files.
    </prop>
    <prop string name="mount" default=".">
      The directory on which to mount. The dirname must be inside the mount. E.g., to serve `example/src/index.js` from `/src/index.js`, the **mount** is `example/src` and **directory** is `src`.
    </prop>
    <prop type="!Object<string, string>" name="override" opt>
      Instead of resolving the _package.json_ path for packages and looking up the module and main fields, paths can be passed manually in the override. E.g., `{ preact: '/node_modules/preact/src/preact.js' }` will serve the source code of _Preact_ instead of the resolved dist version.
    </prop>
    <prop string name="pragma" default="import { h } from 'preact'">
      The pragma function to import. This enables to skip writing `h` at the beginning of each file. JSX will be transpiled to have `h` pragma, therefore to use React it's possible to do `import { createElement: h } from 'react'`.
    </prop>
    <prop type="boolean|!Function" name="log" default="false">
      Log to console when source files were patched.
    </prop>
